# Covid-Symptom-data-analysis
The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged scientists and policy-makers internationally to develop novel approaches to tackle the pandemic. 
Furthermore, it has also been observed that the prevalence and spread of COVID-19 varies across different spatial, temporal and demographics. Despite ramping up testing, we still are not at the required level in most parts of the globe. Therefore, we utilize CMU UMD survey data to understand trends in the spread of COVID- 19. The aim of this study is prioritize people for testing in low resource environment. In order to understand such populations, we perform exploratory data analysis and correlation studies using public health and policy datasets. From our studies, we try to predict the likely % of population that tested positive for COVID-19 based on self-reported symptoms. Our findings reaffirm the predictive value of symptoms, such as anosmia and ageusia. We also study the effect of population density and nutrition values in food and corresponding susceptibility to COVID-19.
